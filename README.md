# EpicGames
An open source project to build a game engine (like Unity or Game Maker)

This project is not about making the best or most popular game engine, it is about learning HOW to make a game engine, and how to contribute to open source. It is intented as a place to learn for new programmers who are interested in building games and learning how to contribute to open source.

This project was started by students at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), but is open to any interested student or jr. developer who wants to learn how to contribute to open source while practicing game programming.
